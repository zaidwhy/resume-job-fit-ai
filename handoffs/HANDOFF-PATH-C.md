# Path C Handoff - Final

## What Was Built

### `db.py` - SQLite persistence layer
- `applications` table: id, job_title, company, score, status, notes, saved_on
- `STATUSES = ["Saved", "Applied", "Interviewing", "Offer", "Rejected"]`
- Functions: `init_db`, `save_application`, `update_status`, `update_notes`, `delete_application`, `get_all_applications`, `get_stats`, `export_csv`
- DB file: `job_tracker.db` in project root - git-ignored, local only

### `pages/2_Job_Tracker.py` - Tracker page
- Summary stats: Total | Avg score | Applied | Interviewing | Offers
- Filter by status + sort (newest / score high→low / low→high)
- Per-application cards: job title, score (colored), live status dropdown, notes input, delete button
- Export all as CSV download

### `app.py` - "Save to tracker" form
- After download buttons: job title + company form → saves to SQLite
- `tracker_saved` session state prevents double-saves; success message guides to sidebar

## All Three Paths - Complete Git History

```
0622ef0 feat: Path B - multi-job comparison, DOCX export, tests + CI
2ef6f6f feat: Path A - Streamlit Cloud deploy + Generate All Sections button
4e23454 feat: LinkedIn profile optimizer tab, copy-to-clipboard UX, higher input limit
6119e28 docs: update README with full feature list and add session handoff
9434fb4 feat: PDF upload, interview prep tab, and skills gap roadmap
```

## The App is Now

A **3-page Streamlit app**:
1. **Main page** (`app.py`) - analyze, generate all, download .txt/.docx, save to tracker
2. **Compare Jobs** (`pages/1_Compare_Jobs.py`) - paste 2–3 JDs, get ranked comparison
3. **Job Tracker** (`pages/2_Job_Tracker.py`) - saved analyses, status tracking, notes, CSV export

Backed by:
- `analyzer.py` - all Gemini logic, 6 public functions, Pydantic schemas
- `db.py` - SQLite persistence, no ORM needed
- `tests/test_analyzer.py` - 26 unit tests, all Gemini mocked
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI on every push

---

## Remaining To-Do (Carry Forward)

- [x] **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud** - live at https://resume-job-fit-ai.streamlit.app (2026-06-17)
- [x] **Update badge URL** - README badge and all page footers point to live URL
- [x] **Update demo screenshot** - 1820×354 composite of all 3 pages from live app (commit 68266a0)
- [ ] **LinkedIn launch post** - `/linkedin-daily-post` skill to announce the live tool

---

## What's Next (Beyond These Paths)

If continuing to build:
1. **Score trend chart** - `st.line_chart` of fit scores over time from the tracker DB
2. **Company research tab** - given a company name, pull key info (culture, recent news, interview format) to prep better
3. **Resume diff viewer** - show before/after for all rewrites side by side with accept/reject buttons

## Context for Future Sessions

- Auto-commit hooks still active - always `git reset --soft HEAD~N` before committing properly
- Free tier: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` always
- `job_tracker.db` is local only - never commit it
- `pages/` directory: Streamlit auto-discovers any `.py` file as a sidebar page, named by filename (underscores → spaces, number prefix → sort order)
- Bash tool Windows paths: avoid `cd C:\...`, git commands work from project root
